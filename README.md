- Driving while distracted, fatigued or drowsy may lead to accidents. Activities that divert the driver's attention from the road ahead, such as engaging in a conversation with other passengers in the car, making or receiving phone calls, sending or receiving text messages, eating while driving or events outside the car may cause driver distraction. Fatigue and drowsiness can result from driving long hours or from lack of sleep.

- The objective of this challenge is to design a detector/classifier that will detect whether the driver is alert or not alert, employing any combination of vehicular, environmental and driver physiological data that are acquired while driving.

- They want to try a new initiative to retain employees.
The idea is to use data to predict whether an employee is likely to leave.
- Once these employees are identified, HR can be more proactive in reaching out to them before it's too late.
They only want to deal with the data that is related to permanent employees.
- Current Practice
Once an employee leaves, he or she is taken an interview with the name “exit interview” and shares reasons for leaving. The HR Department then tries and learns insights from the interview and makes changes accordingly.
- You are given datasets of past employees and their status (still employed or already left). Your task is to build a classification model using the datasets.
